## A place to put things, a collection of things

This allows me to share things with the internet stumbler.

## Testing

I'm using Jest as a test runner. It's got good support for typescript and js-dom out of box.

For testing react components and hooks I like to use `react-testing-library` and `react-hooks-testing-library`.
